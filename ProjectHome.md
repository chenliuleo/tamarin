Tamarin is a simple online grading system for use in introductory programming courses.

Tamarin is modular: graders are dropped-in for each assignment.  These graders can thus be written to handle any submitted file type or programming language.

Tamarin currently offers the most support for grading Java assignments.  A core Java grader library provides tools that allow an assignment submission to be easily and safely graded using reflection in a security sandbox.

Effort is currently underway to add additional support for archived/zip files of code and secure grading of C programs.
